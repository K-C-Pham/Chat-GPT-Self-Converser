This is a fun little python project that connects to ChatGPT through an API.

The program causes ChatGPT to converse with itself, after the user provides an initial prompt, and the number of iterations they wish the program to go through.

The original program used my own GPT key, so the user will have to provide their own key (as far as I'm aware, you can get one for free by making an account).
